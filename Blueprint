/*
For the primal version of this assignment, I will create  
    a two-dimensional array which is the size of the input
    
    int[][] grid = new int[n][n]
    
  But first we must check if n is an odd number.

      static boolean(int n){
        if(n % 2 == 0)
          return false
        else return true    }
        
  If it is odd, we continue. Else, we send back an error message.
  
  Then, we create our array.
